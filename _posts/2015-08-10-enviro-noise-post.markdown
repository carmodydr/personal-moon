A collection of audio recordings from a variety of locations in the western United States.

Often our trips are documented through photography, and it's not out of the ordinary to come back from a long trip with a memory card full of snapshots. But photos address only one of our senses, and our experience of place is far more multidimensional than that. We may bring back food or physical artifacts that contain aspects of other senses, like taste or smell. Or we take videos, which may do a better job than photos at capturing the nature of a place, but even then the emphasis is often more on the visual. Is there a better way to appreciate a spatial experience?

I've been spending the last couple of weeks traveling around the western United States, visiting friends and exploring national parks. As I've traveled through these places, I've tried to remind myself to take note of the wide range of sensations that make up the feeling of a place. In particular, I've been trying to take the time to appreciate the sounds available in all these locations, and as I pause to reflect on the noises that I'm hearing I take a recording. This map is a collection of all those sound snippets. It is, in some sense, my own personal Flickr for sound.

**Tools:**

The audio tracks were recorded with the 'Voice Memos' app on the iPhone. These memos are not automatically geolocated, so mapping was done by hand using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/). These points were then overlayed on a map with the Mapbox API. I closely followed the Mapbox tutorial [Building a store locator](https://www.mapbox.com/guides/building-a-store-locator/) and adapted it for my purposes.
