I am currently a Fellow in the Insight Data Science program. Prior to this I was a physicist and science teacher. I completed my PhD at the University of Wisconsin - Madison in December 2014, and afterwards I was an instructor at Astrocamp in Idyllwild, CA.

## Research
My PhD work was focused on the characterization of instabilities in a magnetically confined plasma and the turbulence that arises as a result. In particular, my work was concerned with the reversed field pinch, a magnetic confinement fusion concept device. A copy of my thesis can be downloaded <a href="carmody_thesis.pdf">here</a>.
